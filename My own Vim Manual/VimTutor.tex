These are notes of $Vim$ taken by myself from books. Not all commands are listed in these lists.
\chapter*{Vim Commands List}

\section*{Rare or unusual commands}
\begin{tabular}{p{4cm} l}
CTRL-] & to jump to a subject under the cursor\\
CTRL-O & to jump back (repeat to go further back)\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\newpage

\section*{Most used commands}
The cursor moving is achieved by pressing the hjkl keys:
\begin{itemize}
\item h $-->$ move to the left
\item j $-->$ move to the bottom
\item k $-->$ move to the top
\item l $-->$ move to the right
\end{itemize}

That is

\hspace*{8cm}k \\
\hspace*{8.5cm}$\wedge$\\
\hspace*{8.5cm}$\>|$\\
\hspace*{7.32cm}h $<$ - - $\>|$ - - $>$ l \\
\hspace*{8.5cm}$\vee$ \\
\hspace*{8.6cm}j \\

By pressing $<ESC>$ Vim goes to Normal mode. \\

By writing $$operator \quad [number] \quad motion$$ the operation $operator$ is repeated $[number]$ times the $motion$. 

"$!$" \hspace*{0.1cm} is the override command modifier.

"$:help$" gives you generic help. \\

\begin{tabular}{p{2.8cm} p{13cm}}
i & to start the Insert mode \\
a & to start the Insert mode at the consecutive cursor's position\\
v & to start the Visual mode \\
x & to delete the character where the cursor is \\
J & joins the next line with the actual one, which the cursor is in and it isn't need to be it at the end \\
CTRL-R & undoes the undo \\
CTRL-O & undoes the undone undo \\
o & opens a new empty line below the cursor and puts $Vim$ in Insert mode \\
O (uppercase) & opens a new empty line above the cursor in Insert Mode \\
ZZ & This writes the file and exits. \\
q! & Quit and throw things away command, whitout saving changes. \\
e! & reloads the original version of the file \\
\hline
